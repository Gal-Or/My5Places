                <p>Maldives , officially the Republic of Maldives, is an archipelagic state in the Indian subcontinent of Asia, situated in the Indian Ocean. 
                    It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres from the Asian continent's mainland. 
                    The chain of 26 atolls stretches from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll in the south . 
                    Comprising a territory spanning roughly 90,000 square kilometre including the sea, land area of all the islands comprises 298 square kilometres , 
                    Maldives is one of the world's most geographically dispersed sovereign states as well as the smallest Asian country by land area and, with around 557,751 inhabitants, the 2nd least populous country in Asia. Mal√© is the capital and the most populated city, 
                    traditionally called the "King's Island" where the ancient royal dynasties ruled for its central location. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    The Maldivian Archipelago is located on the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, a vast submarine mountain range in the Indian Ocean; 
                    this also forms a terrestrial ecoregion, together with the Chagos Archipelago and Lakshadweep. 
                    With an average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres above sea level, 
                    and a highest natural point of only 5.1 metres , it is the world's lowest-lying country.

                    In the 12th century Islam reached the Maldivian Archipelago, which was consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. 
                    From the mid-16th-century, the region came under the increasing influence of European colonial powers, with the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887. 
                    Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. 
                    The ensuing decades have seen political instability, efforts at democratic reform, and environmental challenges posed by climate change. 
                    Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). 
                    It is also a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement. 
                    The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper-middle income economy. 
                    Fishing has historically been the dominant economic activity, 
                    and remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing tourism industry. 
                    The Maldives rates "high" on the Human Development Index, with per capita income significantly higher than other SAARC nations.
                    Maldives was a member of the Commonwealth from July 1982 until withdrawing from the organisation in October 2016 in protest of allegations by other nations of its human rights abuses and failing democracy. 
                    The Maldives rejoined the Commonwealth on 1 February 2020 after showing evidence of functioning democratic processes and popular support.
