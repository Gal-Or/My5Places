                <p>The Grand Canyon  is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in Arizona, United States. 
                    The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and attains a depth of over a mile (6,093 feet or 1,857 meters). 
                    The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park, the Kaibab National Forest, Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument, 
                    the Hualapai Indian Reservation, the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation. 
                    President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of the preservation of the Grand Canyon area and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery.
                    Nearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted. 
                    While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists, several recent studies support the hypothesis that 
                    the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago.
                    Since that time, the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs, 
                    simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon.

                   For thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans, who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. 
                   The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site, and made pilgrimages to it. 
                   The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was García López de Cárdenas from Spain, who arrived in 1540.

                   The Grand Canyon is a river valley in the Colorado Plateau that exposes uplifted Proterozoic and Paleozoic strata, and is also one of the six distinct physiographic sections of the Colorado Plateau province. 
                   Even though it is not the deepest canyon in the world (Kali Gandaki Gorge in Nepal is much deeper), the Grand Canyon is known for its visually overwhelming size and its intricate and colorful landscape. Geologically, 
                   it is significant because of the thick sequence of ancient rocks that are well preserved and exposed in the walls of the canyon. 
                   These rock layers record much of the early geologic history of the North American continent.
